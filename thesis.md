During my Ph.D., I focused on advancing *Sound Event Detection* (SED) using *deep learning* techniques. My research involved developing novel methods to enhance audio signal representations, particularly through a multi-resolution approach that captures diverse time and frequency characteristics of sound events. I participated in the [DCASE Challenge](http://dcase.community/), improving SED performance each year. Additionally, I explored the use of *Source Separation* neural networks to preprocess audio mixtures, leading to cleaner signals and better SED outcomes. 

My work also included proposing a new distractor measure, studying mel-spectrogram resolutions, creating a synthetic dataset for severe event overlap, and analyzing *semi-supervised training* methods. These contributions aimed to address challenging SED scenarios, such as acoustic degradation and event overlap, across various sound event categories.
