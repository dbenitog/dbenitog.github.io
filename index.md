Hi! I'm Diego ðŸ‘‹ 

In **October 2023**, I finished my **PhD Thesis** on Deep Neural Network-based Sound Event Detection and Acoustic Source Separation. Since then, I've been working on innovative, Generative AI-based projects for banking use cases, employing technologies such as Large Language Models, Agents and Retrieval Augmented Generation.
