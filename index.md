Hi! I'm **Diego** ðŸ‘‹ 

In October 2023, I finished my PhD Thesis on Deep Neural Network-based Sound Event Detection and Acoustic Source Separation (you can read it [here](https://repositorio.uam.es/handle/10486/712872)).

Since then, I've been working on innovative, Generative AI-based projects for banking use cases, employing technologies such as Large Language Models, Agents and Retrieval Augmented Generation.
